# Voting System

Building a simple and secure identity system that can be used to replace typical registration systems (e.g. birth record, marriage record, firearm ownership, vehicle ownership, death record)

System will need to work with tangential systems to allow llimited information sharing (e.g. Age checking systems (voting, alcohal, dmv, etc), identity for travel purposes)

Need to work through security protocal to keep an individuals identity from being hijacked.
